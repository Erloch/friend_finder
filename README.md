# friend_finder
This app is used to find a friend that has similar likes to your own. It uses express as well as other functions to hit several different pages to allow the user to interact with the app in the browser. When you first enter the site you are met with a home page with a button linking to a survey page. After filling out the survey the app then calculates who would be the best match for you based on your answers.  

There is a database being built with the users name and photo along with the answers they have submitted. This json list is then recalled by the app to display the info needed to the user about their new friend match. This info is also used to calculate whether you have a match or not.
